# Financial-Inclusion-in-Africa
Predict who in Africa is most likely to have a bank account
The objective of this competition is to create a machine learning model to predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account. 
The models and solutions developed can provide an indication of the state of financial inclusion in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, while providing insights into some of the key factors driving individualsâ€™ financial security.
You are asked to predict the likelihood of the person having a bank account or not (Yes = 1, No = 0), for each unique id in the test dataset . You will train your model on 70% of the data and test your model on the final 30% of the data, across four East African countries - Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda.
